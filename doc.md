# NEW GAME IDEAA:
The world is grey, white. No colors. Only the player and a core in the middle. Our goal is to paint the map using the 3 primary colors (red, green, blue). The map could be "infinite" and we gotta color small portions of a map using specific colors. We could add an automation system (wires, electricity and logic inside the game)

But at night, grey squares turn into dark, black squares. Same thing as in real life, black absorbs any color they can and we gotta prevent that somehow.

Is this idea fire ? yes/no

hell yeah Good idea, I do know a game where the point is to color the map but it is more of an adventure and find the lore game rather than this and there is no logic gameplay.
